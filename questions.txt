Q1: Do tinnitus patients show significant deviations from normative EEG patterns after accounting for age, sex, PTA, and site?

Q2: Are deviations in specific EEG features (e.g., alpha power, connectivity) more common in tinnitus?

Q3: Are larger deviations in certain EEG features associated with higher THI scores?

Q4: Can deviation maps help explain why some tinnitus patients have severe distress and others don’t?

Q5: Are there subgroups of tinnitus patients with different deviation profiles?
For example: one subgroup with abnormal occipital alpha, another with abnormal frontal theta.

Q6: After controlling for PTA in the normative model, do we still see significant deviations in tinnitus patients?

Q7: Can deviation scores predict THI, PTA progression, or classification (tinnitus vs control) better than raw EEG features?



What should be the EEG features?


Spectral / Power features (essential)
Absolute band power per channel/ROI for canonical bands (delta 1–4 Hz, theta 4–8, alpha 8–12, beta 12–30, low-gamma 30–45).
Why: Robust, interpretable; many tinnitus studies report alpha/theta changes.
Relative band power (band power / total power) per channel/ROI.
Why: Controls for between-subject overall power differences.
Log-transformed power (stabilizes variance).
Peak Alpha Frequency (PAF) per subject (global or posterior ROI).
Why: Sensitive to age and cognitive state; useful as a continuous covariate.
Band ratios (e.g., theta/alpha, alpha/beta) per ROI.
Why: Simple summary metrics that sometimes relate to pathology.


Aperiodic / spectral shape
1/f slope and offset (aperiodic component) from methods like FOOOF.
Why: Separates oscillatory peaks from broadband changes—often biologically meaningful.



Connectivity features
Pairwise functional connectivity (per band) using robust measures:
Imaginary coherence or debiased weighted phase-lag index (dwPLI) (less volume-conduction bias).
Amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) for slower coupling.
Why: Network alterations are common in tinnitus; choose measures that limit spurious zero-lag coupling.
Graph/network summary metrics derived from connectivity matrices: node degree, strength, clustering coefficient, modularity, small-worldness (per band).
Why: Compactly captures network topology and reduces dimensionality.




3. Practical workflow for interpretability in your case
Fit NM for each feature set separately (spectral, connectivity, microstates).
Extract covariate effects from the model:
Linear coefficients or kernel sensitivity (GP).
Compute deviation scores for each subject.
Rank features by:
Mean |deviation| in tinnitus vs controls.
Effect size (Cohen’s d) of deviations between groups.
Map features:
Top deviating ROIs → scalp/source map.
Top deviating networks → connectivity graphs.
Relate deviations to symptoms:
Correlation/regression with THI, controlling for PTA.
Visualize in scatterplots with confidence bands.
4. Special bonus for EEG
You can combine interpretability + visualization in a way that’s very intuitive:
Show a normative curve (predicted mean ± 2 SD) for a feature vs age.
Overlay tinnitus subjects and controls, highlighting who falls outside ±2 SD.
This lets you say: “Alpha power in left auditory cortex is expected to be X at age 55, but this tinnitus patient is 3.2 SD below normal.”







Practical hybrid approach (best of both worlds)
Compute features per epoch (you already did).
Aggregate to subject using robust statistics: median as primary, plus MAD (or std) as an uncertainty/QC feature.
Keep epoch-level features for later hierarchical modeling, reliability (ICC) and surrogate testing.
Feed subject-level medians as the NM targets; include MAD, n_clean_epochs, and log_total_power (or SNR) as covariates or additional outputs to account for measurement noise.
Concrete aggregation recipe (recommended)
For each feature (e.g., log_abs_alpha_power in ROI1):
feature_subject = median(epoch_feature_values) → target for NM
feature_dispersion = MAD(epoch_feature_values) → optional covariate / uncertainty
Also store: n_clean_epochs and % rejected_epochs.
Use median + MAD (instead of mean + sd) because EEG epoch values often have outliers.
